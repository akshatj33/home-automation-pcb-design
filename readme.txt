This is a board layout and pcb design which I created for home automation on Eagle CAD platform.
It has 6 PWM pins to control the speed of 6 Fans and two shift registers to controll 16 lights.
The microcontroller used is ATMEGA328 which is basically arduino UNO.
The PCB has connections for bluetooth module so that the device can be controlled through a mobile app.
